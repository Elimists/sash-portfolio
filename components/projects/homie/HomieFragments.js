            <p>Overall, the process of finding and securing a housing rental can be a daunting, overwhelming, and cumbersome journey. Most of the process is learned by word of mouth and through trial and error, making it difficult for inexperienced renters to know where to begin and confidently carry out the entire process. There is also a need for more semi-formal education or resources concerning the renting process as a whole, including knowledge around renter rights. Even more experienced renters encounter a slew of issues relating to poor information across rental ads, usability and experience of rental platforms and listings, communication with landlords and roommates, decision-making, and legal matters.</p>
