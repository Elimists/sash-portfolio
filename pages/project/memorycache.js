                        This 4th year capstone project was centered around the idea of social connectedness and personal informatics.
                        The  challenge was to investigate a problem at the intersection between social interaction and personal data and to create a physical and/or digital solution to address these issues.
                        <b>I chose to focus on the issues of bereavement and mourning caused by the loss of a loved one as this issue was rooted in social connectedness as well as personal informatics.</b>

                    Researching into the issues of grief and how they are connected with social connectedness led me to discover new insights.
                    Through my research evolution I discovered that <b>storytelling and the sharing of memories and memorabilia were extremely enriching and beneficial for people who were mourning.</b>

                    To understand more deeply the process of storytelling and itâ€™s pain-points I would need to conduct user research.
                    To being this process I began by creating a research plan outlining the overview of what I wanted to understand from the user.
                    I broke down the research plan from problem to goal, and then to research questions.
                    After creating the research questions I divided them into interview questions and survey questions as some were more qualitative and others were more quantitative.

                        Next I transcribed the interviews and used data coding to further analyze and identify patterns in the data.

                        The blood pressure monitor was then taken apart to learn more about the

                        device.

                            Taking a look into modern fitness products, current product trends 
                            lean towards clean and minimal designs. Most products have neutral 
                            colors with black and white being the most common.

                        <h3>Initial Sketches</h3>
                        <p>
                            The idea started off by trying to explore solutions for a blood 
                            pressure monitor that could be used wirelessly and charge on a dock 
                            when not in use. Focus was kept on making sure the display could 
                            face the user and not be hard to see.
                        </p>
                        <div>
                            <Image
                                src={IdeationImage2}
                                width={762}
                                height={452}
                                placeholder="blur"
                                blurDataURL={IdeationImage2}
                                alt="Concept sketches for a wireless device"

                        </div>
                        <p>
                            From the ideation sketches low-fidelity mock-ups were constructed 
                            to test the ideas and rank them among each other. Model 4 ranked 
                            the highest in user testing due to its simple form factor, ease of 
                            cuff storage and easy to see display position.

                        <p>
                            Although the finalized concept addressed many of the pain points 
                            from our original blood pressure monitor, it still had a few 
                            shortcomings that were discovered. The main issue with the 
                            finalized concept was that it did not allow for easy portability 
                            as the form was difficult to store. Further ideation was needed to 
                            increase portability and reduce the form factor for traveling 
                            purposes. Exploration into a collapsible device was investigated.

                        Using CAD software allowed for further development as the folding and

                        understood more clearly. After finalizing the CAD model a physical
