### Overview

During my third year of studies our class had the unique experience of working with Dan Barstow, Educational Manager for the International Space Station and Frank White, space philosopher and author of the Overview Effect. We were challenged with the idea of creating a service that could utilize the hundreds of unused satellite images that were taken weekly by the International Space Station. All of these images were free for public use but remained unused and many of them unseen.

### Problem

The International Space Stations takes multiple of photos of earth daily. These images are stored on NASA's website and are free for public use but majority of these photso are never seen by the public and just remain in archives.

### Research

NASA saves many of the satellite images on their **&quot;Windows on Earth&quot;** website which is updated regularly. In recent years NASA has even begun to feature timelapse videos, curating photos into special photo albums, and even created a picture game. Even with these new features majority of the images and videos do not get enough attention. Fortunately, becuase these images already exist on the web and are free for use, there exists an oppurtunity to use these images in other services that could attract more users.

One of the unique phenomenons from viewing the earth from outer space is known as the “Overview Effect”, a term which was popularized by author Frank White. During our time with Frank he noted that in his experience interviewing and studying astronauts who had returned from space many of them had a new perspective on earth, life, and the interconnectedness of it all. It has been discribed as “a cognitive shift in awareness.” I wanted to bring this feeling of the Overview Effect to these satellite images and help users feel that shift in perspective.

### Ideation

The Idea was to create a web application that could show you live satellite imagery and overlayed on the images were contextual information on what was happening in each of those locations. By combining these photos of earth with stories, news, facts, and the general travel of people in those places I could increase a users'’ experience and awareness from more than just looking at a photo.

Contextual information and data for what was happening in each location could be sourced from a variety of existing services. Live tracking of the ISS and Earth Imagery was already possible to source through NASA's own API. Life information and contextual information could be found from social media and news outlets. Travel information could be sourced through flight and marine traffic services which are already public.

### Concept Proposal

The concept proposal showcased a web platform that showed a live video feed of Earth from the International Space Station. Overlayed on the video feed would be location specific information such as local news, social events, and travel information. Users could even upload a their own location specific story. During times when there was no video feed available, the platform would show images instead. The platform also showcased past stories and images with location specific historical information. This concept was proposed as a learning tool and journalism resource.
