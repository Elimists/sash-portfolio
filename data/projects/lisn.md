### Overview

LISN is a startup podcast company developing A.I technologies that help users discover new podcasts and also allow users to create curated playlists using clips from different podcasts. The company is growing its user base and wanted to create an easy to understand onboarding flow for new users. Additionally, they also wanted to design a new home page for their mobile app that facilitated a simplified user-experience. As their new UX/UI designer I led the research and design of their new onboarding flows and mobile app.

---

### Problem

New users were having a hard time understanding the mobile app as there was no introduction provided on how to use the features and how to create podcast clips which was the main service at the time. The organization of the app also left users confused as their content was scattered in different pages and menus.

---

### Research

As a new company, LISN did not have previous user experience research or analysis. I began by creating a research plan and working with the team to identify key areas of the service that we needed to understand better. Our main objective was to understand user goals within the app and their satisfaction with the current platform.

Through interviews and outreach to current users we were able to uncover insights into users‚ pain-points and goals when navigating the app.

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
    <div style="width: 90%; display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
        <h4 style="margin: 0;">Insight 1</h4>
        <p>Users wanted to have their frequently listened to content easily available and have the ability to organize them in the order they preferred (i.e chronological, first to last, most popular, etc).</p>
    </div>
    <div style="width: 90%; display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
        <h4 style="margin: 0;">Insight 2</h4>
        <p>Users wanted to reduce the time searching for a podcast and have their curated content managed for them.</p>
    </div>
</div>

Our team also wanted to highlight key features of the app to new users on our onboarding flows. With some internal discussions we narrowed down our scope into 3 key features that were most important for new users to know.

<div style="display: flex; flex-direction: column; align-items: center;">
    <div style="width: 90%; display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
        <h4 style="margin: 0;">Objective 1</h4>
        <p>Educate users on “conversations”. Conversations is an in-app feature that groups related podcast clips together into a curated playlist for easy and quick listening..</p>
    </div>
    <div style="width: 90%; display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
        <h4 style="margin: 0;">Objective 2</h4>
        <p>Educate users on “Clips”. Clips is an in-app feature that allows users to snip a podcast‚s audio into just the section they are interested in and easily save, share, or use it to create their own conversations.</p>
    </div>
    <div style="width: 90%; display: flex; flex-direction: column;">
        <h4 style="margin: 0;">Objective 3</h4>
        <p>Welcome user feedback. As the app was new we really wanted to invite users to be a part of the growing community and voice their concerns/suggestions to help the service improve.</p>
    </div>

### Ideation

I began the concept development by working on the onboarding screens first. I created some wireframes and focused on keeping the content short and sweet. We wanted to avoid created a long onboarding flow with lots of test. Instead, I decided to use small gifs that could highlight key features and make the onboarding experience more enjoyable.

    <h5>Lo-Fi Mockup</h5>
</p>

For each objective I created a small animation that could represent the feature we wanted to highlight. This also helped create a more visually appealing onboarding flow and good first impression of the app for new users. You can view the animations below on the Final Onboarding Process  section.

### New Home Page Ideation

In addition to the new onboarding pages, we wanted to create a new home page within the app that better organized content and created easy access to the most used features. I started concept development with some competitive analysis and then moved on to create blockframes and wireframes. I was continually testing with the team throughout this process to ensure cohesion and a feasible development scope.

As a good UX principle, we wanted to create a home page that felt familiar for new users. We did not want to overwhelm new users with a completely novel home page that required lots of learning, instead we opted to create a familiar flow to other apps in the podcast/music market space as many of our users also used these services.

### Final Home Page

After testing the concepts within the team concept 1 was the most favourable due to its easy readability, clean layout, and simple development turnaround.
