### Overview

This senior project focused on researching, designing, and validating a digital service that could help improve the user journey in a chosen problem space. Our group chose to tackle the rental housing experience and develop a solution that could streamline the process for beginners and experienced renters.

---
### Problem

The process of finding and securing rental housing can be a daunting, overwhelming, and cumbersome journey. Renters encounter a slew of issues relating to poor information across rental ads, usability and experience of rental platforms and listings, communication with landlords and roommates, decision-making, and legal matters. There is also a need for more education and resources around renter rights.

### User Group

We divided our recruitment into two different types of users. User group 1 was tenants and group 2 were landlords.

### Key Insights & Themes

The results of our user research highlight many pain-points and opportunities for improvement. Using data coding methods (see below) we identified key insights revolved around the lack of standardization of listings, communication methods, lease agreements, and the rental platforms themselves. There was also a need for more personal, accurate, centralized and verified information regarding landlords and their properties (including roommates where applicable).

### Personas

After determining our design brief we created four personas from our background research which captured the breadth of users we wanted to cater to.

<div>
    <div>
        <a target="_blank" href="">
            <img src="" alt="Aiden: Freshmen Student"/>
        </a>
        <h5>Aiden: Freshmen Student</h5>
    </div>
    <div>
        <a target="_blank" href="">
            <img src="" alt="Carly: Long Distance Mover"/>
        </a>
        <h5>Carly: Long Distance Mover</h5>
    </div>
    <div>
        <a target="_blank" href="">
            <img src="" alt="Tamira: New Parent"/>
        </a>
        <h5>Tamira: New Parent</h5>
    </div>
    <div>
        <a target="_blank" href="">
            <img src="" alt="Samu: Young Professional"/>
        </a>
        <h5>Samu: Young Professional</h5>
    </div>
</div>

### User Journey Map

Having uncovered many of the pain-points and opportunities from our research we put together a user journey map that showed the rental housing process from start to finish. This journey map allowed us to visualize where the problem areas where and highlight key touch points that could be improved.

    </a>
    <h5>User Journey Map</h5>
</p>

### Concept Development

#### Competitive Analysis

We began our concept development by doing some market research on existing products and understanding their approach, functionality, and layout.

<p>
    <a target="_blank" href="">
        <img src="" alt="Competitive Analysis" style="width: 100%;"/>
    </a>
    <h5>Competitive Analysis</h5>
</p>

---

#### Application Architecture

The design solution involved creating an information architecture, comprised of all the possible pages, content, features, and user actions for Homie. Each of these assets were then grouped into named categories and organized in a hierarchical structure.

<p>
    <a target="_blank" href="">
        <img src="" alt="Information Architecture" style="width: 100%;"/>
    </a>
    <h5>Information Architecture</h5>
</p>

#### UI Development

We focused our concept development into three key areas of the application that we identified from our research which needed the most improvement.

<p>
    <a target="_blank" href="">
        <img src="" alt="Landlord Portal - Creating and Managing Listings" style="width: 100%;"/>
    </a>
    <h5>Landlord Portal - Creating and Managing Listings</h5>
</p>

<p>
    <a target="_blank" href="">
        <img src="" alt="Browsing and comparing listings" style="width: 100%;"/>
    </a>
    <h5>Browsing and comparing listings</h5>
</p>

<p>
    <a target="_blank" href="">
        <img src="" alt="Booking Viewings" style="width: 100%;"/>
    </a>
    <h5>Booking Viewings</h5>
</p>

---

### User Testing

The usability testing was an eye opening moment for the group to update and improve our design. We asked each participant to complete a certain task, and we were not allowed to intervene. We also timed each participant to understand how efficient each user task was. At the end we interviewed each participant on their experience. Through our user testers, we gained key insights into what features functioned smoothly and what needed tweaking.

### Iterations

After getting the results from our user testing we iterated on the problem areas that confused users. We redesigned certain user flows to have more clarity and organization from the feedback we gained from our testing.

### Final Design

After addressing the concerns from our user testing we began the finalization of the design by creating a branding guideline and developing a high-fidelity version of the application.

        <a target="_blank" href="">
            <img src="" alt="Mood Board"/>
        </a>
        <h5>Mood Board</h5>
    </div>
    <div>
        <a target="_blank" href="">
            <img src="" alt="Landing Page"/>
        </a>
        <h5>Landing Page</h5>
    </div>
    <div>
        <a target="_blank" href="">
            <img src="" alt="Housing Search"/>
        </a>
        <h5>Housing Search</h5>
    </div>
    <div>
        <a target="_blank" href="">
            <img src="" alt="Listing View"/>
        </a>
        <h5>Listing View</h5>
    </div>
    <div>
        <a target="_blank" href="">
            <img src="" alt="Comparison Page"/>
        </a>
        <h5>Comparison Pagee</h5>
    </div>
    <div>
        <a target="_blank" href="">
            <img src="" alt="Messaging View"/>
        </a>
        <h5>Messaging View</h5>
    </div>
    <div>
        <a target="_blank" href="">
            <img src="" alt="Booking Page"/>
        </a>
        <h5>Booking Page</h5>
    </div>
